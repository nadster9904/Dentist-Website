There are several other options to choose from nowadays, including gold, ceramic\/porcelain, composite (tooth-colored), and glass ionomer.<\/div>\n<div class=\"para\" style=\"padding-top: 15px;\">Gold fillings are the most expensive but can last 10-15 years. Ceramic and porcelain fillings can cost as much as gold ones but last more than 15 years and are more resistant to staining than other materials. Composite fillings are the most aesthetically pleasing, but they don\u2019t last as long (maybe 5-10 years) and chip easily.<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"para\" style=\"padding-top: 15px;\">Glass ionomers are not used as often. They are best for cavities below the gum line. They cost about the same as composite fillings but are generally weak and last fewer than five years.<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/details>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<details id=\"e-n-accordion-item-9023\" class=\"e-n-accordion-item\" >\n\t\t\t\t<summary class=\"e-n-accordion-item-title\" data-accordion-index=\"4\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"e-n-accordion-item-9023\" >\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class='e-n-accordion-item-title-header'><div class=\"e-n-accordion-item-title-text\"> Why would I need a crown? <\/div><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class='e-n-accordion-item-title-icon'>\n\t\t\t<span class='e-opened' ><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"e-font-icon-svg e-fas-minus\" viewBox=\"0 0 448 512\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"><path d=\"M416 208H32c-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32v32c0 17.67 14.33 32 32 32h384c17.67 0 32-14.33 32-32v-32c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span>\n\t\t\t<span class='e-closed'><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"e-font-icon-svg e-fas-plus\" viewBox=\"0 0 448 512\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"><path d=\"M416 208H272V64c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32h-32c-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32v144H32c-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32v32c0 17.67 14.33 32 32 32h144v144c0 17.67 14.33 32 32 32h32c17.67 0 32-14.33 32-32V304h144c17.67 0 32-14.33 32-32v-32c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/summary>\n\t\t\t\t<div role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"e-n-accordion-item-9023\" class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-de0efa4 e-con-full e-flex e-con e-child\" data-id=\"de0efa4\" data-element_type=\"container\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4be2d49 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4be2d49\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"para\" style=\"padding-top: 0;\">A crown, also known as a cap, covers up a tooth to restore strength and function.

If you want to fix your less-than-perfect smile but are self-conscious about braces, Invisalign can be the perfect solution. Invisalign uses clear aligners to help you straighten teeth without brackets and wires. You use multiple sets of aligners to gradually move your teeth into the desired position.<\/div>\n<div class=\"para\" style=\"padding-top: 15px;\">Invisalign can fix a variety of mild to moderate alignment cases, including crowded or crooked teeth, gaps between teeth, underbite, overbite, crossbite, and open bite.
